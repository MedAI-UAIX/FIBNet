# Code for "US-based Sequential Algorithm Integrating an AI Model for Advanced Liver Fibrosis Screening"

Welcome to the official repository for our research on using ultrasound in conjunction with AI models to screen for advanced liver fibrosis. This repository contains the code accompanying our published article.

## About the Project
This project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of an AI-driven model combined with ultrasound imaging to identify and screen for advanced liver fibrosis. The approach is detailed in our paper, where we discuss the methodology, challenges, and outcomes of integrating AI with traditional imaging techniques.

## Additional Data Sets and Parameters
We encourage other researchers to reference our work and use it as a foundation for further study. If you require additional test datasets or parameters for more robust validation, please contact the corresponding author of the paper.
